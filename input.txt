# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

We’re building a distributed platform where each patient has a secure, centralized profile aggregating all their lab results and medical interactions across specialties. Docker-based microservices will manage authentication, profile data, and analysis of tests. Doctors—from family practitioners to specialists—can access a patient’s complete history (dates, values, notes) via a REST API. A dedicated scheduling microservice tracks test dates and automatically sends reminders when new work is due. The system ensures data privacy, seamless collaboration among care teams, and timely alerts so that clinicians and patients can stay proactive about long-term health maintenance.
