INSTRUCTIONS:
Conducting and presenting the projects

Here are the instructions for conducting and presenting your projects.

Register your group and idea / high-level specification within the cut-off date. The registration is binding, i.e., if not registered by the cut-off date, you cannot discuss your project. But then you can discuss it whenever you want during the year.

After the approval of the idea by the instructor, you have to define the requirements by defining the user stories of your entire system. User stories can be documented by using spreadsheets (as the one proposed in a post), and collecting all of them at the end of the project in a booklet.

For each user story, it should be provided also a LoFi mockup, to be prepared with the suggested tools (e.g., Balsamiq), and a textual description highlighting specific non functional requirements (if any).

After the definition of the user stories/requirements, you need to estimate the complexity of the software development, time and effort to carry it out, by using Function Points and COCOMO II methods.

The analysis should be presented through spreadsheets (see the material) and a booklet explaining and detailing your method.

At the end of the academic year, it will be interesting to compare estimation with actual KLOCs of the projects.

After requirements and estimation of the effort, you may design your project and document the software architecture.

The development process should be based on SCRUM. It is required that you define the different sprints you may want to adopt for the development, each one with goals and planning.

You can document the SCRUM method by adopting specific spreadsheets that have been published.

At the end, all the work done (design of the system, software architecture, sprints with relevant analytics, e.g., burndown charts) should be documented in a booklet.

The system is being developed in whatever technologies/framework you may want. The release should be done by providing the link of a GitHub repo with all the source code, configuration files, any other file you may need (please remember we have adopted a IaC approach - Infrastructure as Code) AND the Dockerfiles, docker-compose files, etc. which will allow the instructors to re-build/re-deploy your system on whatever platform (either on-premise or on cloud).
